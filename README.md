GraphRecognitionFrontend
========================

* Developed a graph recognition system which recognizes a graph(with nodes and edges) drawn on a html5 canvas using geometric recognition.
* Any graph algorithm(BFS, DFS, Topological Sort) can be run on the recognized graph by implementing a generic interface that provides the graph object. The results of the execution are sent back to be displayed on the front-end.
